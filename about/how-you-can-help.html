<h3>Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF)</h3>
<p>
Every three minutes, somewhere in the world, an MAF plane takes off or lands, enabling and multiplying the effectiveness of relief and development agencies, missions, local churches and
other national groups.
</p>
<p>
MAF multiplies the effectiveness of those we fly by making it possible for donations entrusted to partner agencies to be spent on immediate aid where it matters most, rather than on days of dangerous and costly overland travel.
