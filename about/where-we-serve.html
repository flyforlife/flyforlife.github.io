We are living in the capital city of Kinshasa, located on the west side of the DR Congo in Africa. <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/about/kinshasa.png" title="Kinshasha" alt="Kinshasha"/>   From that city, MAF flies goods and personnel to service the needs of missionaries and communities in rural locations.

Transportation is a <strong>HUGE</strong> issue in Congo. Decades of war and corruption have destroyed the infrastructure, and many roads and bridges are impassable.  It can sometimes take weeks of driving between the largest cities in the country.  The same distance can be flown in less than a day! Can you imagine the difference an airplane makes for say...transporting patients...or bringing relief food and water...or how about a short term team that can only be there for a month! We are so excited to be on a team that are serving the desperate needs in DR Congo.
