<strong>Brett</strong> grew up in Calgary, Alberta, in a Christian family. He was the second of three boys, and enjoyed baseball, flying model airplanes, and going to a Christian kids’ camp. It was at camp where he realized that he could not just follow along on his parents’ faith, and at 14 he committed his life to
Christ.

God drew Brett’s attention to mission aviation with a “MAF” magnet on his parents’ fridge.  
Brett studied aircraft structures and mechanics at SAIT in Calgary.  Following this, God orchestrated a move to the small town of Three Hills, AB where he was able to study at Prairie School of Mission Aviation. There he obtained his maintenance license and completed his flight training, including Class 3 Instructor Rating and Single Engine IFR. Since then he has been gaining experience in Calgary as both a pilot and a M1/M2 certified Aircraft Maintenance Engineer in preparation for serving overseas.

<strong>Jaclyn</strong> also grew up in Calgary, and has one brother and two sisters. Her parents were involved in full time children’s ministry, and she gave her heart to Jesus at an early age. As she grew up, she saw God’s provision and faithfulness to her family in many ways. By the time she was a young teen, Jaclyn was convinced that God was enough to meet her own needs too.  God placed in her a heart for missions and a desire to teach and disciple others. Jaclyn earned her Bachelor of Nursing degree after high school, and has enjoyed working in all aspects of maternity care, including teaching nursing for 3 years.
